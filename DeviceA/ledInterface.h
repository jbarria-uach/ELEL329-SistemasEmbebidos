 * 
 * An interface module to wrap GPIO handling to control LEDs. It supports
 * PWM intensity control.
 * @note It may be overkill in the context of this project  because it's used
 *       just to wrap digitalWrite() calls, but it exists because of initial 
 *       misunderstanding of "duty cycle" specified in 3.1.
